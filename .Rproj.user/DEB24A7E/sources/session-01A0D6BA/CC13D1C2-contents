# The story so far

You are here because you have a grasp of the R skills required to complete R Programming 1. See [here](https://sccbioinformatics.github.io/R_programming_1/) for the course material. In summary, that course covers:

* RStudio
  + Navigating the panes
  + Writing scripts
* Vectors
* Matrices
  + Subsetting
  + Manipulating
* Lists
  * Creating
  * Accessing
* Data Frames
  + Making ggplots from
* Reading and writing files
  + Reading in expression data
  + Writing out tables
* Flow control basics
  + `for`,`if`, `else` statements
* Functions
  + Creating
  + Using them
* `apply`
  + Using built-in functions like `sum` and `var`
  + Using `apply` with your own functions
* Standardising data
  + z-scoring data for clustering
* Clustering
  + Hierarchical clustering rows and columns
  + `pheatmap`
* Linear models
  + Writing the models
  + Extracting differentially expressed genes
* Kmeans
  + Programming from scratch
  + Starting to write algorithms
* The Final Project
  + Clustering using simulated annealing

## What will be covered

All chapter sections start with a second-level (`##`) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
