# The fun starts nowâ€¦

The purpose of this course is to extend your knowledge of R and to start exploring the ideas of classes, object-orientated programming, package creation and version control. By combining these skill the idea is that you will start developing your own tools and making them available for anyone in the work to use.

This will be a fairly intense workshop, but if you can crack it will boost your knowledge and confidence even further, and will hopefully teach you how to read other peoples' code too.
