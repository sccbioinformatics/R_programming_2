# Including data in a package.

***This is an optional extra, but a very useful one.***

R packages will often include small example datasets the user can load to try out the package without having to go and find their own. These are usually called by doing:

```{r, eval=F}
data(data.pbmc)
```

Read [this](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/data.html) and see how you can include the raw count data in your package!
